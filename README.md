# ARP-Spoof-Protection
## Description
This is an ARP Spoofing protection system which detects an ARP Spoof attack and prevents the victim from losing confidential information to the hacker.
## Working
The system detects an ARP Spoof attack and secures the system by disconnecting the internet of the victim's computer, which is why the hacker's computer could not become the Man in the Middle and thus prevents it from accessing the victim's computer. The system will reconnect to internet after sometime, and again if it detects an ARP Spoof then it will disconnect the system, and this process will continue in an infinite loop until and unless the attack stops.
## Conclusion
The hacker will get irritated and finally will stop the attack.
